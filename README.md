# UK-Calliope-2.0

## Data sources
The data on gas the gas infrastructure was obtained by manually parsing a [map](https://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/gas-transmission/land-and-assets/network-route-maps) of the national grid network. 
As the carrying capacities of the gas pipes are publically avaiable, I used a simple linear model to estimate them based on other gas piplelines with a known gas transport capacity. 

The data on the heating technologies comes from the [danish energy agency](https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Analyser/technology_data_catalogue_for_individual_heating_installations.pdf)
The technologies are generic and based on average vaulues of several configuarations, i.e retroffitting/new homes and single or multi family homes.
